I created this enhanced Arduino Framework for the Longan Nano module. The module is inexpensive and has lots of nice features, but the Arduino framework lags behind the native SDK for the GD32V. I've added some crude code for USB Serial, I2C and SPI. Its far from complete but should be useful as a starting point.
